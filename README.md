Facebook-3D-Globe
=================

Here is a WebGL Globe from http://www.chromeexperiments.com/globe what I chose to visualize FB Friends and their location. Currently I'm just playing around with it and thinking of new stuff what is interesting to display.


If you want to help with some stuff - just let me know.
Help is always welcome !

Cheers
